  ## Description
  Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

  Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


  ## Installation
  1. Download the starter code from GitHub.
  2. Install dependencies using "npm install" 
  3. Connect to MySQL database:
  ``` mysql -u root -p``` 
  * Create the database schema
  ```source db/schema.sql;```
  * Exit the database
  ``` exit```
  * Populate the database
  ``` npm run seed```
  * Start the server
  ```$ node server```
  4. Now you are ready to use on Insomnia!
